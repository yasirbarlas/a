# Cryptocurrencies and Dates of Interest

This project goes into the analysis of cryptocurrencies that are listed on CoinMarketCap. The library "cryptocmd" was used in order to achieve this. The coin analysed in this project is XRP.

There are a few areas addressed in this project:

- A plot of the value of the chosen cryptocurrency is looked at for users to see how the coin's value has changed since launch
- A function, namely "difference", was created to find the difference in value between yesterday and any other chosen time since the coin was launched

One may decide to manipulate the code and change the coin from "XRP" to "BTC" for example, results will change but the code will still work.

The project is still ongoing and more functions and areas will be looked at which will aid with the analysis of cryptocurrencies.
